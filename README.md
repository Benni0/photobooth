# Photobooth

A Photobooth web interface for Raspberry Pi and Windows.

Photobooth was initially developped by Andre Rinas, you can find his source [here](https://github.com/andreknieriem/photobooth).

This is my personal Photobooth fork with some extras on top (more information can be found [below](https://github.com/andi34/photobooth#extras-on-my-personal-fork)).

**Please note:**

Safari Browser on iOS 9 in not compatible with es6, which means Photobooth won't work. Supported browser can be found inside the [Wiki](https://github.com/andi34/photobooth/wiki#browser-support).
If you like to use an old iPad anyway, please take a look [here (andi34/photobooth#47)](https://github.com/andi34/photobooth/issues/47).
If I find enough time I'll post some updates from time to time
